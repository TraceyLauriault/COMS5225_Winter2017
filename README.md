# Course Description

> The emphasis of this class is to learn to envision data genealogically, as assemblages, as part of a dispositif and infrastructure in order to reframe them beyond technological conceptions. Emphasis will be on the sociotechnical, political and philosophical aspects of data. During the term we will explore data, facts and truth; the power of data both big and small; governmentality and biopolitics; risk, probability and the taming of chance; algorithmic culture, dynamic nominalism, categorization and ontologies; and the circularity of the transduction and translation of people, space and social phenomena into and by data and software and finally we will discuss the role of data in the production of knowledge.

### Reading Reportage (25%):
In the Week 1 class, a paper reportage schedule will be made and names have been added to the outline an a shared spreadsheet was created.  Student will select a set of readings, will briefly share their observations about the readings (issues, difficulties, concepts, ideas, theories, dataset, examples, etc.) and will lead the in-class discussion based on those readings for a set period of time. Students are not required to have a Power Point presentation but can if they wish to. Students are however expected to have personal notes and may want to augment the discussion with examples related to datasets they are working on, previous research, and etc.

### Data Description and Conceptualization- Due Week 2 11:55 Jan. 17 (10%):

Select a dataset directly related to a topic or a subject you might engage with or are currently engaged with in your graduate work. Or any other dataset if you want to explore something new for the purpose of this assignment. It can be sourced from any source and consider how that factors into trusting the data and conceptions of the data.

In a total of 3 pages describe them technically and in such a way that 10 years from now you will be able to decipher the nature of these data. Technical descriptions of data generally include the following, but do not be limited to this: consider format, sample size, headings, metadata, include licences and terms of use, where did you find them (portal, blog, library), producing institution, data authors if there are any, who created them, dates, geography, classifications, and etc. Be sure to cite the dataset & provide the URL, be sure to cite any other documentation, you can use footnotes if you like, but use full citation. Get to know these data and familiarize yourself with them.

You will also conceptually frame these data by applying at least 2 of Kitchin's conceptualizations beyond the technical one just described. The chapter is attached. I also attached the Genevieve Bell's chapter as is it a very nice intro into thinking about data.

You might also want to say a little something about your interest in this dataset, what you might use the data for and explain what led you to trust these data.

You are welcome to use screen-captures and they will not go against your page count. Think of this as part lab report, part critically informed commentary.

### Poster Project (4 parts):

Students will demonstrate their familiarity with the course material by applying concepts and theories about critical data studies in relation to a specific dataset, database, algorithm, data infrastructure, standards and etc. of their choice and will communicate these in a scientific poster format.

#### 3.1 Poster Project Proposal, Week 3 Jan.24, 11:55PM (5%), 1 page Quad Chart:

1. Introduce the dataset, database, indicator, data infrastructure, data standard you will discuss in your poster.

2. Provide two potential research questions.

3. State which theory, philosophy and concepts you plan to engage with & why.

4. References.

#### 3.2 Poster Project Abstract for Data Day 4.0 Week 5 Feb. 15 11:55 PM (10%):

Abstracts for posters are often a little longer.  For the moment plan for 500 to 750 words, or approximately one page of text which includes title, your name, institution. Once the call for poster abstracts is made by CUIDs those specifications will apply.

#### 3.3 Digital Draft of Poster for In-Class Peer Review Week 7 Mar. 1, in class (5%):

Detailed specification for the poster will follow the CUIDS Call. Note that a poster as a form of scholarly communication is common in medical, scientific fields, geomatics and engineering. The following are some general instructions to guide the production of your posters but keep in mind that your poster will be somewhat different and you will have to adapt these techniques to critical data studies. Also, note this is not an infographic, this is a ‘scientific’ poster.Here are some useful guidelines:

* [NYU Libraries Guide](http://guides.nyu.edu/c.php?g=276826&p=1846154)

* [Urbana Champaign Library Guide](http://guides.library.illinois.edu/c.php?g=347412&p=2343433)

* [10 Simple Rules for a Good Poster Presentation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1876493/)

#### 3.4 Final Poster Week of March 29, (25%):

If your poster is accepted for Data Day 4.0 a print out of your poster will be required and generally there is a cost to this and I will endeavour to negotiate with some labs to get a reduced price or to get them done for free on plotter printers. I cannot guarantee that I can get this done for free however. Also, you will have to be present at the poster session to speak with people and at judging. Should your poster not be accepted a digital copy only is to be submitted. Whether or not your poster is accepted does not affect your mark.  Detailed specifications to follow.

### Data Day 4.0 Session Blog Post Due Week 12 (10%):

Data Day 4.0 is a full day event on March 29. There is no class on that day as you are expected to attend the event. Students will select a panel session and will report observations in a 500 – 750 word blog post. A blog post is part description, observation, and critical reflection. Posts can include images & pictures, graphs & tables, quotes by speakers or tweet quotes, and hyperlinks to content related to what was discussed, reflections and the CUIDS. I will discuss with CUIDS if these can be published on their Blog and if not I will find an alternative public forum to publish the posts. Final submissions however will be in a word document and be formatted as you would expect it to be in a blog post.

### Late Policy:

Extensions must be requested in advance, in person, and will typically require documentation of an extended illness or other significant disruption to your ability to complete the required work.

## Week 12 (Apr. 5) – Assemblages, Genealogies and Dynamic Nominalism
No readings are assigned for this week. In-class we will examine three methodological approaches that can be applied to the study of data big and small. Examples will be drawn from the professor’s first-hand experience in three cities and three different case studies. In addition we will review the theories discussed throughout the term, share observations about Data Day 4.0.
